MarqueeScroll
=============

MarqueeScroll is a sample/test application that simply scrolls text across the screen if the text is wider than the screen. Very simple animation using a UIScrollView. It also implements a gradient view.

Instructions
------------

Requires iOS 8, but should really run on older versions as well.
Updated for Xcode 10 and Swift 5. Really no changes for that, but did very minor cleanup on stuff that I'd missed.
